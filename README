Keynotes:

This project is programmed and built by Tyler Aubin. The project is a mask effectivity comparator, with the end goal for this project is to build a device capable of measuring respiration data from an individuals mask, and reporting whether their mask should be swapped for an onsite disposable mask. This project is aimed at implementation in schools, hospitals, workplaces, offices, stores, etc. The project was inspired by the novel Coronavirus of 2020. 

test.py, which will be referred to as Test, is the current main script for the project. Test operates by first checking if a result file exists in the working directory. This will need to be implemented on the application end of the project; in short it will not be implemented into the remote device, for the remote device will not use an operating system. Test then uses a simple calibration algorithm that samples the relative humidity sensor for 100 consecutive measurements within +- 1% of one another. This ensures the temperature has reached equilibrium, and is ready for use once more. With the sensor ready, the program then asks the user to remove their mask, and breathe onto the device. This data is then polled, and the algorithm reports the highest measured relative humidity measurement compared to a baseline measurement taken at startup. The device is then recalibrated using the same sampling algorithm previously mentioned, and repeats measuring the patient except with their mask on. The percent relative humidity with mask on vs mask off is then reported as the mask efficiency. This calculation is found using % w/ mask on / % w/ mask off.
