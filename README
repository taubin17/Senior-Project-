Keynotes:

This project is programmed and built by Tyler Aubin. The project is a mask effectivity comparator, with the end goal for this project is to build a device capable of measuring respiration data from an individuals mask, and reporting whether their mask should be swapped for an onsite disposable mask. This project is aimed at implementation in schools, hospitals, workplaces, offices, stores, etc. The project was inspired by the novel Coronavirus of 2020. 

Using the STM NUCLEOF446 in the future will require the code to be written in C/C++. However, a third party development software called micropython is devoloped for this particular board and others, which may be used depending on time.
