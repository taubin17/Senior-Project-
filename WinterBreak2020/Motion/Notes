Testing the VCNL4010 confirms that measurements cannot be reliably converted to physical distance.
However, correlation does show for less accurate measurements. To elaborate, differentiating 4 and 5 inches apart with the VCNL4010 is possible.
The Inverse is true as well however, differentiating 0.003mm to 0.008 mm is not feasible, as noise is excessive.
Project constraints list that the project must detect between 0.5in and 4in. While other sensors will be looked into, the VCNL4010 can be written to work
